<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

:woman_student: This is my BrainStation Data Science Bootcamp's Capstone project. 

:dart: The aim of this project is to use machine learning algorithms to gain more insights into traffic accidents that involve cyclists and predict potentially dangerous locations or situations for cyclists in the city of Toronto.  


## Details on Datasets

All data analysis and modelling processes in this project are based on the following datasets: 

:police_officer: Killed or Seriously Injured Dataset which was retrieved from the [Toronto Police Services Public Safety Open Data Portal](https://data.torontopolice.on.ca/datasets/TorontoPS::ksi/about).

:sun_behind_rain_cloud: Daily precipitation rate from 2006 to 2020 which was retrieved from the [Government of Canada's Past weather and climate historical data](https://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_data/daily_data_e.html?hlyRange=1953-01-01%7C1969-05-31&dlyRange=1840-03-01%7C2017-04-27&mlyRange=1840-01-01%7C2006-12-01&StationID=5051&Prov=ON&urlExtension=_e.html&searchType=stnProv&optLimit=yearRange&StartYear=2006&EndYear=2020&selRowPerPage=25&Line=369&lstProvince=ON&timeframe=2&Day=26&Year=2006&Month=1#) recorded by the Toronto Station.

## Built With

The visualizations and machine learning models in the project were built by using Jupyter Notebook, Plotly, Scikit-Learn, and other Python libraries.

## Getting Started

:file_folder: The project is divided into 2 parts which are organized into 2 notebooks: 

:heavy_check_mark: Part 1: Early Data Analysis and Data Cleaning

:heavy_check_mark: Part 2: Modelling  

:paperclip: The information to set up the environment which was used to run the notebooks can be found in the timeseries_environment.txt file. 

:paperclip: A brief summary of the project is included as a pdf file in the repository.
